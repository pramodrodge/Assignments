Currently starting with Association Rules assignment which has 3 problems for Books, Groceries and Movies.
Different files are being uploaded based on the assignments provided. File names are as referred below and it contains two sets of files
1. File name with the snapshot of the outputs generated from the R or Python codes
2. Actual code written in the R or Python language

File naming convention for both above types - <Topic name> + <Assignment> + <Problem type> + <versioniong>. For e.g. For "Association Rules" topic
the file name would be as "Association Rules Assignment My Movies v0.1" and similarly for the R or Python code file.
